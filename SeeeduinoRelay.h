// Hardware note:
// Note the relay shield needs the 9V power supply on the board hooked up in order to 
// actually be able to fire the relays.  This 9V on the sheild does not power the UNO board.
// If you power the Arduino board from it's power connector, then the shield is powered
// that way, so you don't need two power connectors.  i.e. - you can't run the relays 
// with just USB power. 
//
// Although this library was written with the Seeedstudio relay shield in mind, it will
// work perfectly line with generic relays. Just change the "RELAYxPIN" definitions below. 
//

// Software Note: Seeeduino has THREE e's, not two as you might think.  Check that
// first when trying to find unresolved references.
